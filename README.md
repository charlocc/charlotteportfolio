## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Goal: 

This is a portfolio to share with hiring managers when I am looking to attain jobs in software development.

There are four sections in my portfolio. 
* In the "About me", you will find my name, a recent photo, and a short bio.
* In the "My work" section, you will find titled images of my previous works
* In the "Contact" section, you will find interactive links with my email, phone number, LinkedIn, and Github
* In the "Resume" section, you will find a pdf copy of my resume

To navigate the site, if you click the links in the navigation, each link will bring you to the corresponding part of the webpage. 

If you click on the images in the "My Work" section of the page, you will be taken to that deployed application (currently these images are placeholders until I have work to link). 
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application




WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
